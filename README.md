# Welcome to my Profile!

Hello! I'm Syamsul Hilmi, also known as Triff. I was one of the translators of Dead Cells Indonesian Translation Project.

As of now, I'm currently developing a game, and I'm interested in game developments and modding. There are two main ways of contacting me: 

* Discord: Triffy.#4833
* Steam: https://steamcommunity.com/id/TrifectaRose/

Note that I can speak both Indonesian (native) and English.
